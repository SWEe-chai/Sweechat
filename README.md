SweeChat is an iOS messaging application that aims to foster the development of encouraging education communities. This project is built as part of the [final project](https://cs3217.github.io/cs3217-docs/final-project-guidelines/final-project-requirements/) of [CS3217 (Software Engineering on Modern Application Platforms)](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS3217/software-engineering-on-modern-application-platforms). We were given the freedom to build anything we wanted and decided to create a messaging application from scratch. This was a great learning experience for us.

SweeChat was built on the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) software architectural pattern. Notable engineering feats include cryptography, notifications, media caching, and message pagination.

## Setup

You will need to set up a Firebase environment with notifications enabled and add a suitable to the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the Sweechat folder before being able to build and run the app. An Apple developer account is required to turn on push notifications.
